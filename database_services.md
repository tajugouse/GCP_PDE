# Professional Data Engineer

> A Professional Data Engineer enables data-driven decision making by

    collecting, transforming, and publishing data. 
    
> A data engineer should be able to 

    design, build, operationalize, secure, and monitor data processing systems with a particular emphasis on 
    
    - security and compliance; 
    - scalability and efficiency; 
    - reliability and fidelity; 
    - flexibility and portability. 
    
A data engineer should also be able to 

    leverage, deploy, and continuously train pre-existing machine learning models.

And that concludes in below four parts:

1. Designing data processing systems

    - Selecting the appropriate storage technologies
    - Designing data pipelines
    - Designing a data processing solution
    - Migrating data warehousing and data processing

2. Building and operationalizing data processing systems

    - Building and operationalizing storage systems
    - Building and operationalizing pipelines
    - Building and operationalizing processing infrastructure

3. Operationalizing machine learning models

    - Deploying an ML pipeline
    - Leveraging pre-built ML models as a service
    - Choosing the appropriate training and serving infrastructure
    - Measuring, monitoring, and troubleshooting machine learning models

4. Ensuring solution quality

    - Designing for security and compliance
    - Ensuring scalability and efficiency
    - Ensuring reliability and fidelity
    - Ensuring flexibility and portability

### Managed Databases
Managed Databases is a general term that refers to a database service that is fully managed by the cloud provider, in this case, Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This means that GCP handles the underlying infrastructure, maintenance, and management of the database, allowing you to focus on developing your application.

### Cloud SQL
Cloud SQL is a managed database service that allows you to run MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server databases in the cloud. It provides features such as replication, automated backups, and failover to ensure high availability and resilience. Cloud SQL is a good choice for applications that require a relational database management system (RDBMS).

### DataStore
DataStore is a NoSQL database service that allows you to store and manage large amounts of structured and unstructured data. It is designed for applications that require high scalability and low latency. DataStore is a good choice for applications that require a flexible schema and high performance.

### Bigtable
Bigtable is a fully managed NoSQL database service that is designed for large-scale analytics and data processing workloads. It is ideal for storing large amounts of data with very low latency and is a great choice for applications such as IoT, user analytics, and financial data analysis.

### Cloud Spanner
Cloud Spanner is a fully managed relational database service that is designed for large-scale database applications. It provides features such as horizontal scalability, high performance, and strong consistency, making it a good choice for applications that require a relational database management system (RDBMS) with high scalability and performance.

> In summary, the main differences between these services are:

- Cloud SQL: Relational database service for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server databases.
- DataStore: NoSQL database service for structured and unstructured data.
- Bigtable: NoSQL database service for large-scale analytics and data processing workloads.
- Cloud Spanner: Relational database service for large-scale database applications with high scalability and performance.
### When to choose each service:

- Choose Cloud SQL for applications that require a relational database management system (RDBMS) with high availability and resilience.
- Choose DataStore for applications that require a flexible schema and high performance.
- Choose Bigtable for applications that require low latency and high scalability for large-scale analytics and data processing workloads.
- Choose Cloud Spanner for applications that require a relational database management system (RDBMS) with high scalability and performance.
